# stupefying-programs
Contains some of the most useful programs ever to have been developed.

Sike

The first pattern given is:
1, 6, 12, 18, 24, etc.

2nd:
1, 7, 19, 37, 61, etc.

3rd:
1, 8, 27, 64, 125, etc. (Notice the cubes!)

4th:
1, 9, 36, 100, 225, etc. (Notice the squares!)

rth?
Determined by a researcher named Gary Detlefs (http://oeis.org/A024166)

This program prints out sequences between the 1st (-2nd) sequence and the rth sequence, with r = 0 defined as the 3rd sequence. The number of terms and the number of sequences can be adjusted if desired.
